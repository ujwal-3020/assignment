Showcase different merging strategies in git including visual demonstration of those strategies.

1. FAST FORWARD MERGE

    - A fast forward merge occurs when the branch being merged can be fast forwarded to the target branch because there have been no
      divergent commits

    BEFORE MERGE : A-B-C
                      \
                       D-E

    AFTER MERGE : A-B-C-D-E


2. THREE WAY MERGE
    - A three way merge occurs when the branch being merged has diverged from the target branch. Git creates a new commit to combine changes from both branches

    BEFORE MERGE : A-B-C
                      \
                       D-E

    AFTER MERGE : A-B-C---F
                     \   /
                      D-E


3. SQUASH MERGE
    - It combines all commits from the source branch into single commit and applies it to the target branch. This is useful for keeping a clean history

    BEFORE MERGE : A-B-C
                      \
                       D-E-F

    AFTER MERGE : A-B-C-G
                       /  
                      D-E-F


4. REBASE MERGE
    - Rebasing involves applying commits from one branch onto another, effectively rewriting the commit history

    BEFORE REBASE : A-B-C (main)
                      \
                       D-E (feature)

    AFTER REBASE : A-B-C-D'-E' (feature)
