You deleted a branch and later found that there are commits which need to be recovered. Define the approach and solution for this.

# CHECK THE REFLOG

1. View reflog
    - git reflog
2. Identify the commit hash
3. Create a new branch from the commit
    - git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>
4. git push origin <new-branch-name>


# RECOVER FROM A BACKUP

1. Locate the backup repo
2. Fetch the deleted branch
    - git fetch <backup-repo> <deleted-branch-name>
3. Create a new branch
    - git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash-from-backup>
4. git push origin <new-branch-name>
